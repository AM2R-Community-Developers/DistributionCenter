## 1/7/2022: AM2RLauncher 2.2.0 release!
EDIT: At this point it's almost tradition here that our auto-updater is broken. Ideally you'll see an update recovery tool for ~5 seconds and then get to use the AM2RLauncher 2.2.0 upon launch. If any other problems occur, please contact us in the Discord server.

Late happy new year to y'all! Here's a new release. Full changelog can be found at GitHub, most prominent features are that users now have the option to independently update AM2R and the Launcher, quickly open the folder where profile's contents are located and some more QoL improvements.  
Also while technically not AM2RLauncher related, Linux users now shouldn't need to use environment variables depending on their GPU anymore! We know that many of you didn't know they were needed in the first place and resorted to WINE, we hope that you'll consider using the Linux-native version instead now!  
***YOU WILL NEED TO REINSTALL ALL YOUR PROFILES FOR THIS TO TAKE EFFECT!*** You also still need the 32-bit architecture added to your system to play the game and the 32-bit variant of `libpulse` and `openal` for sound. 
And you're actually able to use .NET Core 5 **and higher** now, instead of being limited to .NET Core 5 only. Please update to at least .NET Core 6, as we're going to bump it up to that version in the future.

## 8/20/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.1.2 release!

Auto-updater was STILL broken. 2.1.1 will crash on a first update attempt but when launched again will fix itself on Windows - unfortunately, Linux is a little more broken and requires a manual reinstall. Changelog can be found on GitHub, as usual.

## 8/16/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.1.1 release!

Auto-updater was still busted, so there's another recovery tool. It should be fully resolved now, but we all know what happened when we said that last time.

This was primarily a Linux update, but there are a few QoL changes to Windows as well. Changelog can be found on GitHub, as usual.

## 6/7/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.1.0 release!

We goofed and the auto-updater was broken. Ideally you'll see an update recovery tool for ~5 seconds and then get to use the AM2RLauncher 2.1.0 upon launch. Changelog can be found on GitHub, as usual.

Note: Mod saves will likely disappear if they were set to use a custom directory due to a bugfix. Help locating these missing saves can be found on the Official AM2R Discord Server.

## 3/27/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.0.0 release!

The release was off to a bit of a rocky start, but after a hotfix and build push we managed to solve an issue regarding the auto-update routine. Thank you all for your patience.
