#### What is AM2R 2.0?
A full graphical overhaul of AM2R, plus some Other Changes™.

#### What are these Other Changes™?
We're not ready to share all of them yet, but you can expect some modifications to the Metroid fights and better modding support.

#### What is the 2.0 artstyle?
It's distinct from the other Metroid titles. You could think of it as something akin to a fusion of Zero Mission, Super Metroid, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but that's just a generalization.

#### When will 2.0 release?
When it's finished. Please stop asking.

#### Will the soundtrack be replaced?
None of the original tracks created by DoctorM64 and his friends will be replaced, with a possible exception for the credits theme due to the increasing length of the credits list.

#### Will the game be made more like Metroid: Samus Returns?
Not intentionally. Some elements may inadvertently become more similar to M:SR as a result of graphical and gameplay changes, but we have no intentions of trying to replace or usurp the official remake. We want both games to remain distinct, and we still want AM2R 2.0 to feel like AM2R!

#### Will Ridley be added to the ending?
