#### Milton 'DoctorM64' Guasti was sent a Cease and Desist (C&D) notice.
False. DoctorM64 was sent a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice, which is different from a C&D for several reasons. We are not lawyers, however, so we will leave detailing the differences to others.

#### AM2R got to release because it was quiet during development and never got demos.
False. AM2R had several demos - both the Confrontation engine demos and some actual builds of the game's early areas.

#### AM2R is built in the Zero Mission engine.
False. AM2R was programmed from scratch in GameMaker: Studio 1.4. DoctorM64 carefully tuned the player animations and physics to align with aspects of Zero Mission, however, as the goal was to remake the original game in Zero Mission's style.

#### AM2R was built by one person.
Half-truth. It is true that DoctorM64 did all of the level and gameplay design, the vast majority of the soundtrack and programming, and a large portion of the art assets and writing, but he had numerous contributors who made the project possible and who are consequently listed in the credits.

#### Ridley is not in AM2R
False. Ridley can be found near the end of the game, but only appears if you backtrack through the planet with the baby to collect 100% of the remaining items. 

#### Septoggs will be avaliable in 2.0
False. The septoggs have been removed due to issues with their ugliness and general stupidity. Their co-creator has been fired out of a cannon and will not be a part of any future press releases.

#### Lojical (leader of community updates) dislikes being doxxed.
False. As a cybersecurity expert, Lojical welcomes any and all attacks on their wherabouts at all times. He openly invites the internet to "na-na-na-na-na-na, catch me if you can, shmucks!

#### Lojical's adress is not 706 Heather Ct, Griffith, Indiana(IN)
False again. This is actually completely founded and 100% true.
